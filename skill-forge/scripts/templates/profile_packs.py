## Required metadata

- author
- year or publication date
- title
- publisher, journal, or site
- URL or DOI when available
- access date only when the style or source type requires it

## Common trigger phrases

- APA format
- MLA format
- Chicago citation
- Harvard referencing
- in-text citation
- reference list
- works cited
- bibliography

## Style reminders

- APA: author-date emphasis, year near the author, sentence-case article titles.
- MLA: author-page emphasis when page numbers exist, title formatting matters.
- Chicago: decide between notes-bibliography and author-date before drafting.
- Harvard: author-date structure, institution-specific variants are common.

## Hard rule

Never invent a citation. Mark missing metadata explicitly.
If the user asks for a finished bibliography and metadata is incomplete, produce a missing-fields table instead.
